<pre>
Spring came and melted the snow and ice.
The earth was covered in soft velvet.
Freed from winter's hibernation and heartache
all that lives dings with its heart to warmth and light.

The birds fly in and spring entered the blossoming garden,
and the youths made a racket like fledglings.
The old men rose again as from the grave
and are honestly happy to meet again their friends.

The families hurry to their kinsmen in the nearby aul:
embraces, exclamations—a happy commotion.
Young laughter is carried on the air in triumph.
The people have shaken off the winter worries.

Sharp cries come from the she-camels and the lambs
bleat in the yard.
Butterflies and birds flutter in the ravines.
Powerful streams burble, wind and flow
under the fixed gaze of trees and flowers.

Swans and geese glide decorously past the banks.
The children rush about searching for birds' nests.
You gallop on your winged horse.
The hawk soars up, its plumage flashing,
you strap the prey to your saddle—
and the girls playfully block your way.

  Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
  That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
  Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
  That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
  Say the word, on my way
  Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
  Any night, any day
  Say the word, on my way
  Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
  In the mornin' or the late
  Say the word, on my way
